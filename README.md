# Learning C from *Let Us C*

## ðŸ“˜ About This Repository
This repository documents my journey of learning the C programming language entirely through self-study using the classic book **_Let Us C_** by **Yashavant Kanetkar**.

I completed all the exercises and examples from this book, covering everything from basics to advanced topics like pointers and file handling.
Each folder contains solutions organized by chapter.
This journey strengthened my understanding of C language and built a solid foundation for learning other languages like C++, Python, and Java.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- GCC Compiler  
- VS Code IDE  
- Git & GitHub for version control  

## ðŸ’¼ Connect With Me
Iâ€™m always open to collaborating, discussing programming concepts, or exploring new opportunities.

Be composable and generic, allowing users to write code that can be used with many different types of execution resources.
Encapsulate common asynchronous patterns in customizable and reusable algorithms, so users don’t have to invent things themselves.
Make it easy to be correct by construction.
Support the diversity of execution resources and execution agents, because not all execution agents are created equal; some are less capable than others, but not less important.
Allow everything to be customized by an execution resource, including transfer to other execution resources, but don’t require that execution resources customize everything.
Care about all reasonable use cases, domains and platforms.
Errors must be propagated, but error handling must not present a burden.
